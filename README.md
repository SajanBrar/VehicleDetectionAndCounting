# VehicleDetectionAndCounting

## Problem Statement
To build a self adaptive traffic light control system based on YOLO. Disproportionate and diverse traffic in different lanes leads to inefficient utilization of same time slot for each of them characterized by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queuing.
To create a system which enable the traffic management system to take time allocation decisions for a particular lane according to the traffic density on other different lanes with the help of cameras, image processing modules. 

## About the Implementation
Monitor traffic on a crossroad using cameras, each monitoring a lane. 
These cameras will input images every few seconds to the software. Different types of vehicles will be detected using YOLO. 
Based on this data the traffic lights will be set for an adequate time.
This will lead to more rate of traffic flow, through the signals.
